# FinanceApp

FinanceApp helps you track your finances easily.  
It allows you to manage multiple bank accounts, investments, and transfers in one place.

It is usual to own many bank accounts for different purposes: investing, saving up, daily usage... This makes difficult to track the money. To maintain good finances it is useful to have everything tracked in one place. This allows planning ahead and prevents that sense of moving money with no purpose.
